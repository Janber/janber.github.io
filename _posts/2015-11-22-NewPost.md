###Creating a Git repository
Every time a new project is getting created in Xcode, the capability to add a local git repository is always given as an option to the developer. In a project creation, a three-step guided process is involved, and at the third and last step of it Xcode provides a check box with the appropriate message, which if selected the git repository is added to the project’s directory. It’s easy this option to be overlooked or to be considered as another unneeded Xcode feature, and usually that’s what happens, especially in cases of developers who have never worked with version control and git before, or they are new to programming.

To see everything in details, launch Xcode and create a new project. Firstly, as the application’s template select the Single View Application, in the Application category under the iOS section.
